    <h2>Quiet Chicken Piccata</h2>
    <p>This chicken piccata recipe is quick and easy. Pounded chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 Skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons capers, drained</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.</li>
